README FOR Linux::Cpuinfo
==========================

Linux::Cpuinfo is a module that provides an object oriented interface to
the /proc/cpuinfo on Linux systems.  This file contains information about
the CPU (or CPUs) in the computer which may be of use for diagnostic
purposes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

There are no other modules needed.  The only absolute dependency is that
there is a file that contains the same information as the /proc/cpuinfo
found on Linux systems with the 2.2.16 kernel with the procfs configured.

I would be delighted if this was found to work on other systems than Linux
and indeed if other OS do have a similar interface then I might be 
persuaded to include support for them in future releases.

Since the original release of this module I have received copies of the
/proc/cpuinfo from a variety of architectures from a number of people
which has been very helpful in developing this module further.  
Keep them coming - and if you understand what the information means a 
little note explaining it for inclusion in the documentation would
be very welcome.
